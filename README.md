# Computational graph

This repo is a Python 3 implementation of a computational graph to do deep learning. I learned in that all big deep learning librairies used that principle so I wanted to understand it and to do that I implemented it.
## Getting Started

Simply clone this repo

### Prerequisites

Essential : Numpy

```
pip install numpy
```
Optional : Graphviz

### Example

Run fully, fully_mnist, conv or conv_mnist in the terminal

This is the supposed output of the fully file.

This image represent the dataset used, it is a 2d dataset with two classes in a XOR position with a little bit of noise so that perfect separation if impossible
