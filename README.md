# Computational Graph
This repo is a Python 3 implementation of a computational graph to deep learning.
I learned in that all big deep learning librairies use that principle so I wanted to understand it. 
It is much simpler than my "mlp" repo and much more scalable.


Fun to implement


To see a result just launch the test file.
